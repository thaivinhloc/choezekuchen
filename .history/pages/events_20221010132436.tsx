              On the 10th day of the month of the Pig, Guru Padmasambhava
              transformed the poison concocted by the Tirthikas into nectar with
              his magical powers. His healthy radiance transformed the mind of
              the Tirtikas and converted them and their retinues to the Dharma.
              He became known as Guru Nyima Ozer or Suryaprabha, the Guru who is
              like rays of the sun. On the Anniversary of Guru Nyima Ozer, one
              of Guru Padmasambhavaâ€™s manifestations, we are pleased to announce
              the online teaching and prayers of Guru Rinpoche, conducted by
              11th Choeze Kuchen Rinpoche.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the age of 21, the 11th Choeze Kuchen Rinpoche founded his
              first retreat Center, Choeze Thupten Dargyeling in the eastern
              part of Tibet in Kham under the Yushu, Qinghai Province, China,
              where more than 200 Lamas completed 3 years, 3 months and 3 days
              of retreats.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the monastery was destroyed by the 2010 earthquake, the 11th
              Choeze Kuchen Rinpoche undertook the rebuilding of a new monastery
              in Dzachukha.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017, Choeze Kuchen Rinpoche completed the construction and put
              into operation the first clinic in Dzachukha region, Kham Tibet
              Province, providing medical care for local people as well as for
              monks and nuns in the region.
