              After practising, we accumulate merit and we should dedicate this
              merit. This teaching explains how to do perfect dedication.
              Without dedication, even if you have accumulated merits for
              thousands of aeons, all of the merits may be destroyed by a single
              negative thought. Merit is like a drop of water. If you put it on
              a dry ground, it will evaporate in a short period of time. If you
              do dedication, it will be like putting the drop of water in an
              ocean, the drop of water will last as long as the ocean is still
              around. Only if we dedicate merit, can the merit last. So
              dedication is very important. How should we do dedication? We
              should dedicate all the past, present and future merits of
              ourselves, all sentient beings, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
              as well as the source of all good deeds, our Buddha nature. This
              is the special method of Kyobpa Jigten Sumgon, the founder of the
              Drikung Kagyud lineage. Why should we dedicate future merit? We
              may forget to dedicate merits in future when we have done good
              deeds, so we dedicate merit now for those circumstances.
              Dedicating future merits will also make it easier for us to
              accumulate merit in the future.

              Impure motivation is having jealousy, greed, desire of benefitting
              oneself or one’s family and other negative and selfish thoughts
              before performing the deed. Pure motivation is doing the virtuous
              deed without any prior negative and selfish thoughts.
