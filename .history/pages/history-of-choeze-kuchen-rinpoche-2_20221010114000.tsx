              After practising, we accumulate merit and we should dedicate this
              merit. This teaching explains how to do perfect dedication.
              Without dedication, even if you have accumulated merits for
              thousands of aeons, all of the merits may be destroyed by a single
              negative thought. Merit is like a drop of water. If you put it on
              a dry ground, it will evaporate in a short period of time. If you
              do dedication, it will be like putting the drop of water in an
              ocean, the drop of water will last as long as the ocean is still
              around. Only if we dedicate merit, can the merit last. So
              dedication is very important. How should we do dedication? We
              should dedicate all the past, present and future merits of
              ourselves, all sentient beings, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
              as well as the source of all good deeds, our Buddha nature. This
              is the special method of Kyobpa Jigten Sumgon, the founder of the
              Drikung Kagyud lineage. Why should we dedicate future merit? We
              may forget to dedicate merits in future when we have done good
              deeds, so we dedicate merit now for those circumstances.
              Dedicating future merits will also make it easier for us to
              accumulate merit in the future.

              Primoridal merit is the merit of our natural self or our Buddha
              nature. Our original mind or self is kind and pure in nature.
              There are many people who are without religion but are naturally
              compassionate and kind. Why? Because their nature itself is good
              and kind. Even for animals, you can see how good they are to their
              children, they also possess compassion. We survive in this world
              through compassion, kindness and care given by our mother. We can
              see that the real nature of sentient beings is compassion. This
              strong and powerful compassion, is the seed of all merits. We
              should dedicate this.

              For any deeds that we perform, whether it is Dharma-related or
              not, we need these 3 excellences. Pure motivation, perfect way to
              practice and perfect dedication. It applies to every practice and
              is very much essential and necessary.
